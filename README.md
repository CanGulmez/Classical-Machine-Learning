# Classical Machine Learning

This repository has been created for classical machine learning. The primary book that 
is referenced is `Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow`. This 
book was divided into two parts. I just prove the first part. Second part is related
about deep learning. I wanna implement different repository for deep learning.
